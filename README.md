# xview

(WIP) a simple file/log viewer in flutter

# TODO

- app icon & name
- search bar
- make tab icon looks better
- code refactor
  - multiple file support
  - a better scrolling controller that can center on a specific index and position specific element at particular offset
  - save file state. maybe need a notifier/listener
  - bigger file support (~100M). stream loading
  - empty file page

# Known issue

- hover will not work if the windows is not active or in focus
